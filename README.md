This is a git repository for the several packages I forked. This space will
be used as a location for saving the RPMs I build and their respective
tar.gz archives. Packages created for Arch Linux will be uploaded to
http://aur4.archlinux.org

NOTE: Some of the packages does not have releases, so I will use the version
number 0.1 for them. Packages in development will have the first five 
numbers of their latest git commit so they don't conflict with 'official'
ones.
